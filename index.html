    <h3>The Story</h3>

    <!-- <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q><em>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</em></q>The farmer said,
        <q><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again
        said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong></p>

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q><em>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</em></q> and the farmer responded, <q><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q> The next
        day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q><em>“Isn’t that great!”</em></q> Again, he said, <q><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q>
    </p>

    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never
        know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
